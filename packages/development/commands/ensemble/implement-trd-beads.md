Parse a TRD and create a beads hierarchy (epic -> stories -> tasks) before
any implementation begins. Drive execution order through bv --robot-next (with
br ready fallback) rather than TRD re-parsing. Record all state transitions
in br beads so the implementation is resumable across sessions without access
to local state files.

This command wraps the implement-trd-enhanced execution model with a full
beads project management layer powered by br (beads_rust) and bv (beads_viewer).
It transforms TRD-structured work into a persistent, queryable beads hierarchy
and drives execution order through bv --robot-next — enabling cross-session
resumability, graph-aware triage, and parallel execution planning.

Key behaviors:
- Scaffold: epic -> stories -> tasks created in br before first line of code
- Idempotency: existing scaffolds detected via title-prefix matching; partial scaffolds resumed safely
- Execution: bv --robot-next determines what to run next (fallback: br ready)
- Quality gates: phase completion triggers test delegation; results recorded as br comments
- Sync: br sync --flush-only exports JSONL before every bv call
- Wheel instructions: printed every run with NTM spawn commands for multi-agent flywheel
- Graceful degradation: bv features skipped if bv unavailable; br required
- No .trd-state/ files: beads + JSONL are the single source of truth

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Preflight

**1. Handle Special Arguments**
   Process --status and --reset-task arguments for early exit paths

   - If $ARGUMENTS contains '--status' AND TEAM_MODE=true: (TRD-029, AC: FR-IT-8, AC-BC-2)
   -   1. Derive TRD_SLUG from filename (same derivation as normal Preflight step 4)
   -   2. Run: br list --status=in_progress --json, filter by [trd:<TRD_SLUG>:task:] prefix
   -   3. For each in-progress task: call get_sub_state(bead_id) to get sub-state
   -   4. Group and print:
   -        '=== TEAM STATUS: <TRD_SLUG> ==='
   -        'Tasks in_progress (building): <N>'  -- list task IDs and assigned builder
   -        'Tasks in_review: <N>'               -- list task IDs and reviewer
   -        'Tasks in_qa: <N>'                   -- list task IDs and QA agent
   -        For each task with rejection count > 0: show 'Task <ID>: <N> rejections'
   -        'Tasks completed: <M> / <Total>'
   -        '================================='
   -   5. EXIT
   - If $ARGUMENTS contains '--status' AND TEAM_MODE=false: derive TRD_SLUG, run br list --status=open --json, filter JSON for entries with title matching [trd:<TRD_SLUG>] to find epic, then if BV_AVAILABLE run bv --robot-triage --format toon else run br list --status=open --json filtered by TRD slug, EXIT
   - If $ARGUMENTS contains '--reset-task' AND TEAM_MODE=true: (TRD-030, AC: FR-IT-9, AC-BC-3)
   -   1. Extract TASK_ID from argument
   -   2. Find bead: br list --status=open --json OR br list --status=in_progress --json
   -      Filter for title containing [trd:<TRD_SLUG>:task:<TASK_ID>]
   -   3. Reset br native status: br update <bead_id> --status=open
   -   4. Add reset comment: br comment add <bead_id> 'status:open reset:manual reason:--reset-task'
   -   5. Run: br sync --flush-only
   -   6. Print: 'Reset task <TASK_ID> (bead: <bead_id>) to open. Team sub-state cleared.'
   -   7. EXIT
   - If $ARGUMENTS contains '--reset-task' AND TEAM_MODE=false: extract TASK_ID, run br list --status=open --json, filter JSON for entry with title containing [trd:<TRD_SLUG>:task:<TASK_ID>], run br update <BEAD_ID> --status=open, EXIT

**2. Tool Availability Check**
   Verify br is installed and functional, detect bv availability

   - which br || { echo 'ERROR: br (beads_rust) not installed. Install from https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust'; exit 1; }
   - br list --status=open > /dev/null 2>&1 || { echo 'ERROR: br not functional'; exit 1; }
   - which bv && BV_AVAILABLE=true || { echo 'WARNING: bv (beads_viewer) not installed. Graph-aware triage will be unavailable. Install from https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer'; BV_AVAILABLE=false; }

**3. Git-Town and Working Directory Verification**
   Verify git-town installed and working directory is clean

   - Run: bash packages/git/skills/git-town/scripts/validate-git-town.sh — handle exit codes 0 (ok), 1 (not installed), 2 (not configured), 3 (version mismatch), 4 (not git repo)
   - Run: git status --porcelain — HALT if output non-empty (dirty working directory)

**4. TRD Selection and Validation**
   Locate and validate the target TRD file

   - Priority: $ARGUMENTS .md path -> $ARGUMENTS name search in docs/TRD/ -> single in-progress TRD in docs/TRD/ -> prompt user
   - Validate: file exists, contains Master Task List section, contains at least one '- [ ] **TRD-' entry
   - Derive TRD_SLUG from filename: lowercase, replace non-alphanumeric with hyphens, strip leading/trailing hyphens

**5. Resume Detection**
   Check for existing beads scaffold to enable cross-session resume

   - Run: br list --status=open --json
   - Parse JSON output, search for entry where title matches pattern [trd:<TRD_SLUG>] with type epic
   - If found: set ROOT_EPIC_ID from JSON .id field, run br sync --flush-only, then if BV_AVAILABLE run bv --robot-triage --format toon else run br list --status=open --json filtered by TRD slug, skip Scaffold phase, proceed to Execute
   - If not found: proceed to Feature Branch Creation then Scaffold
   - 
   - TRD-028 — Cross-Session Resume with Team Sub-State (AC: FR-IT-7, NFR-R-1, AC-RS-1, AC-RS-2, AC-RS-3, AC-RS-4):
   - When TEAM_MODE=true AND existing scaffold found (resume detected):
   -   1. Existing scaffold detection (unchanged): find ROOT_EPIC_ID by [trd:<TRD_SLUG>] epic bead
   -   2. Reconstruct team config: re-parse using precedence order -- (1) check TRD file for '## Team Configuration' section first, (2) fall back to command YAML team: section. This ensures that edits to TRD team config between sessions are picked up on resume.
   -   3. Scan all in-progress task beads: br list --status=in_progress --json, filter by TRD slug
   -   4. For each in-progress bead, call get_sub_state(bead_id) to determine pipeline stage:
   -      a. sub_state == 'in_progress' with assigned: comment -> re-delegate to same builder (or new one if original failed)
   -      b. sub_state == 'in_review' -> delegate directly to reviewer with context from builder comment
   -      c. sub_state == 'in_qa' -> delegate directly to QA with context from reviewer comment
   -      d. sub_state == 'in_progress' with verdict:rejected in previous comment -> re-delegate to builder with rejection context
   -   5. Print resume summary:
   -      '=== RESUMING TEAM EXECUTION: <TRD_SLUG> ==='
   -      'Tasks in_progress (building): <N>'
   -      'Tasks in_review: <N>'
   -      'Tasks in_qa: <N>'
   -      'Tasks completed: <M>'
   -      'Team config: lead=<agent>, builders=<list>, reviewer=<agent or none>, QA=<agent or none>'
   -      '=== Resuming lead loop... ==='
   -   6. Skip Scaffold phase (scaffold already exists)
   -   7. Proceed directly to Lead Orchestration Loop
   - 
   - TRD-038 — Backward Compatibility with Existing v2.1.0 Scaffolds (AC: FR-IT-4, FR-IT-6, NFR-C-1, NFR-C-2, NFR-C-3, NFR-C-4, AC-BC-4):
   - When TEAM_MODE=true resuming a v2.1.0 scaffold:
   -   1. v2.1.0 beads have no status: comments -> get_sub_state() returns ('in_progress', {}) via native fallback
   -   2. Lead treats these beads as in_progress (builder stage): re-delegates to builder
   -   3. No structural differences: v2.1.0 creates same bead types (epic/feature/task) with same title format
   -   4. Team mode adds comments but does not modify bead types or titles
   -   5. br list, bv --robot-next, br ready all work identically with team-mode beads
   -   6. The status:in_progress comment written by lead when claiming is the only addition
   -   Key invariant: if a bead has no status: comments, it is treated as in builder stage (in_progress),
   -   which is the safe default for resuming any in-progress bead from v2.1.0.
   - 
   - When TEAM_MODE=false AND resume detected: existing v2.1.0 resume behavior unchanged

**6. Feature Branch Creation**
   Create or switch to feature branch for TRD implementation

   - branch_name = 'feature/<TRD_SLUG>'
   - Run: git branch --list <branch_name>
   - If exists: git switch <branch_name>
   - If not exists: git town hack <branch_name> (fallback: git switch -c <branch_name>)

**7. Strategy Detection**
   Determine implementation strategy from arguments, TRD content, or auto-detection

   - Priority: $ARGUMENTS strategy=X -> TRD explicit -> constitution -> auto-detect -> default (tdd)
   - Auto-detect: legacy/brownfield/untested -> characterization; bug fix/regression -> bug-fix; refactor/tech debt -> refactor; prototype/spike/POC -> test-after; default -> tdd

**8. Team Configuration Detection**
   Determine team mode using precedence order: (1) TRD ## Team Configuration section,
(2) command YAML team: section, (3) no team (single-agent). Sets TEAM_MODE,
TEAM_CONFIG_SOURCE, TEAM_ROLES, REVIEWER_ENABLED, and QA_ENABLED for all subsequent
steps. AC: FR-TD-1, FR-TD-2, FR-TD-6, FR-TD-7, FR-TD-8, AC-TD-1, AC-TD-2, AC-TD-3,
FR-5.1, FR-5.2, FR-5.3, FR-5.4, FR-5.5, FR-5.6, NFR-1.3, NFR-4.2


   - === TRD-FIRST PARSING (TRD-029, TRD-031) ===
   - Step 0 — TRD team config check: search the TRD file (already loaded in step 4) for '## Team Configuration' heading
   - If '## Team Configuration' heading found in TRD:
   -   a. Extract the YAML code block immediately following the heading (delimited by triple backticks with yaml language tag)
   -   b. Parse the extracted YAML; validate schema:
   -      - Verify team.roles array exists
   -      - Verify 'lead' and 'builder' roles are present in team.roles
   -      - Verify agent: and agents: fields are mutually exclusive per role
   -      - Verify owns: list is non-empty for each role
   -   c. If YAML parse fails or schema violations found: print specific validation errors with details (role name, field, issue) and HALT
   -   d. If valid: use this team config; set TEAM_CONFIG_SOURCE='trd'; log 'Team config source: TRD document'; proceed to role extraction (Step 2)
   - If '## Team Configuration' section NOT found in TRD: fall through to command YAML check below
   - 
   - === COMMAND YAML FALLBACK (existing logic) ===
   - Step 1 — Presence check: examine whether this file (implement-trd-beads.yaml) contains a top-level 'team:' key (uncommented, active YAML, not inside a comment block)
   - If team: is ABSENT: set TEAM_MODE=false; set TEAM_CONFIG_SOURCE='none'; print 'TEAM MODE: disabled (single-agent execution)'; skip all subsequent team-related steps and proceed with single-agent defaults
   - If team: is PRESENT: set TEAM_CONFIG_SOURCE='yaml'; set TEAM_MODE=true; log 'Team config source: command YAML'; continue with steps below
   - 
   - === ROLE EXTRACTION AND VALIDATION (applies to both sources) ===
   - Step 2 — Role extraction: iterate over team.roles list and build TEAM_ROLES map:
   -   For each role entry in team.roles:
   -     - Read name: field (required; must be one of: lead | builder | reviewer | qa)
   -     - Read agent: (singular string) OR agents: (list of strings) — these are mutually exclusive
   -     - Normalize: if agent: was used, convert to agents: [agent_name] so all downstream code uses agents: uniformly
   -     - Read owns: list (required)
   -     - Store as TEAM_ROLES[name] = {agents: [...], owns: [...]}
   -   Result shape: TEAM_ROLES = {lead: {agents: [...], owns: [...]}, builder: {agents: [...], owns: [...]}, reviewer: {agents: [...], owns: [...]}, qa: {agents: [...], owns: [...]}}
   - Step 3 — Required role validation:
   -   If 'lead' NOT in TEAM_ROLES: print 'ERROR: team.roles must include a lead role'; HALT
   -   If 'builder' NOT in TEAM_ROLES: print 'ERROR: team.roles must include a builder role'; HALT
   - Step 4 — Agent registry validation (AC: AC-TD-2, FR-5.6):
   -   Build KNOWN_AGENTS list:
   -     1. Scan packages/*/agents/*.yaml using glob pattern
   -     2. For each file: extract basename, strip .yaml extension -> agent name
   -     3. Also scan .claude/router-rules.json if it exists: extract any custom agent names defined there
   -     4. Deduplicate into KNOWN_AGENTS set (sorted alphabetically for deterministic output)
   -   For each role in TEAM_ROLES:
   -     For each agent name in role.agents:
   -       If agent_name NOT in KNOWN_AGENTS:
   -         Print: "ERROR: Agent '<agent_name>' referenced in team role '<role_name>' not found in ensemble registry."
   -         Print: "Known agents: <sorted comma-separated KNOWN_AGENTS list>"
   -         Print: "Check packages/*/agents/*.yaml for available agents."
   -         HALT
   -   On success: print "Agent registry validation passed: all <N> referenced agents verified."
   - Step 5 — Optional role flags:
   -   Set REVIEWER_ENABLED = true if 'reviewer' key exists in TEAM_ROLES, else false
   -   Set QA_ENABLED = true if 'qa' key exists in TEAM_ROLES, else false
   - Step 6 — Configuration summary: print team configuration summary:
   -   'TEAM MODE: enabled'
   -   'Team config source: {TEAM_CONFIG_SOURCE}'
   -   'Lead: <TEAM_ROLES.lead.agents[0]>'
   -   'Builders: <TEAM_ROLES.builder.agents joined by comma>'
   -   'Reviewer: <TEAM_ROLES.reviewer.agents[0] if REVIEWER_ENABLED else none>'
   -   'QA: <TEAM_ROLES.qa.agents[0] if QA_ENABLED else none>'
   -   Also print which steps will be skipped (TRD-023):
   -   'Skipped steps: <review (if REVIEWER_ENABLED=false), qa (if QA_ENABLED=false), or none>'
   - 
   - TRD-023 — Graceful Degradation for Partial Teams (AC: FR-GD-4, FR-GD-5, FR-GD-6, AC-TD-4):
   - Case 1: REVIEWER_ENABLED=false (no reviewer role defined):
   -   - Skip review step entirely
   -   - After builder: validate_transition(bead_id, 'in_qa') if QA_ENABLED else validate_transition(bead_id, 'closed')
   -   - br comment add <bead_id> 'status:skip-review lead:<agent> reason:no-reviewer-role-defined'
   - Case 2: QA_ENABLED=false (no qa role defined):
   -   - Skip QA step entirely
   -   - After reviewer approval: validate_transition(bead_id, 'closed')
   -   - br comment add <bead_id> 'status:skip-qa lead:<agent> reason:no-qa-role-defined'
   - Case 3: REVIEWER_ENABLED=false AND QA_ENABLED=false:
   -   - Lead orchestration loop active, builder implements, lead closes directly
   -   - After builder: validate_transition(bead_id, 'closed')
   -   - br comment add <bead_id> 'status:closed lead:<agent> reason:no-reviewer-no-qa-direct-close'
   - Case 4: Only lead+builder defined (same as Case 3):
   -   - Identical to Case 3
   - Record which steps are skipped in the team configuration summary printed during this Preflight step.

**9. Marketplace Preflight Check**
   Before execution begins, check for marketplace capability gaps that may affect team
config quality. Presents suggestions for missing agents/skills and installs approved
plugins. Re-reads team config from TRD after installation if agents referenced in TRD
team config are now available. AC: FR-11.1 through FR-11.6, AC-8.1 through AC-8.6


   - Step 1 — Load marketplace.json: Read marketplace.json from repository root
   - If missing or malformed: log 'marketplace.json not found -- skipping marketplace preflight'; skip remaining steps
   - Step 2 — Domain scan: identify TRD task domains using same keyword matching as /create-trd Phase 4 Step 3
   - Step 3 — Installed-plugin detection: for each plugin in marketplace.json derive local path from source field; use Glob to check packages/<name>/ directory; build PREFLIGHT_INSTALLED set
   - Step 4 — Gap analysis: for each TRD domain check if default agent exists in packages/*/agents/*.yaml registry; for framework-specific keywords check corresponding skills/ directory
   - Exclude plugins already in PREFLIGHT_INSTALLED; consolidate multiple gaps pointing to same plugin
   - Context-aware filtering: generic 'test' keyword alone must NOT trigger testing framework suggestions
   - Step 5 — Track declined plugins within this session: build SESSION_DECLINED_PLUGINS set (empty at start)
   - Step 6 — For each gap suggestion (excluding SESSION_DECLINED_PLUGINS):
   -   If AskUserQuestion is available: present yes/no prompt with plugin name, description, rationale, agents/skills provided
   -   If user approves: run 'claude plugin install <plugin_name>' via Bash; verify packages/<name>/ directory created
   -   If user declines: add to SESSION_DECLINED_PLUGINS (do not re-suggest during this session)
   -   If non-interactive: log suggestion as [INFO] and skip all installations
   - Step 7 — If any plugins were installed:
   -   Re-run agent discovery: scan packages/*/agents/*.yaml to refresh KNOWN_AGENTS and AGENT_REGISTRY
   -   If TEAM_CONFIG_SOURCE='trd': re-read ## Team Configuration from TRD and re-validate agents against refreshed registry
   -   If newly installed agents ARE referenced in TRD team config: log 'Newly installed agents now available for team config'
   -   If newly installed agents are NOT referenced in TRD team config: log 'Note: newly installed agents not referenced in TRD team config. Consider re-running /create-trd to update team configuration.'
   - Step 8 — If user declines all suggestions: proceed with existing team config and available agents

**10. Traceability Validation Gate**
   Run validate-requirements as an automatic preflight gate before scaffolding begins.
Checks that PRD requirements have TRD task coverage, that [satisfies] annotations
reference real REQ-NNN IDs, and that every user-facing task has a paired -TEST task.
Errors (orphaned annotations) halt execution; warnings are printed but do not halt.
Skipped if TRD has no [satisfies] annotations (legacy TRD without traceability).


   - Step 1 — Check for traceability annotations: scan TRD content for any '[satisfies REQ-' token
   - If NO [satisfies REQ-] annotations found: print 'NOTE: TRD has no [satisfies] annotations — skipping traceability validation (legacy TRD). Run /create-trd to regenerate with traceability.'; skip remaining steps
   - Step 2 — Locate PRD reference: search TRD for PRD path using priority order: (1) docs/PRD/*.md link (most specific), (2) 'Based on PRD: <path>', (3) 'PRD: <path>'. After extracting a candidate path, verify it looks like a file path (contains '/' or ends in '.md') before setting PRD_PATH.
   - If PRD path found: set PRD_PATH to that path
   - If PRD path NOT found: print 'WARNING: No PRD reference found in TRD — skipping traceability validation. Add a PRD reference to enable this gate.'; skip remaining steps
   - Verify PRD_PATH exists on disk. If not: print 'WARNING: PRD file not found at <PRD_PATH> — skipping traceability validation. Fix the PRD path in the TRD.'; skip remaining validation steps and proceed to Scaffold.
   - Step 3 — Run validation: invoke the validate-requirements logic inline (do not spawn a new agent):
   -   a. Parse PRD_PATH for all REQ-NNN IDs and AC-NNN-M IDs — build PRD_REQUIREMENTS map
   -      If PRD_REQUIREMENTS is empty AND PRD file is non-empty: print 'WARNING: PRD parsed but no REQ-NNN headings found — PRD may use a different format. Skipping validation.' Skip remaining validation steps and proceed to Scaffold.
   -   b. Parse TRD for all [satisfies REQ-NNN], [verifies TRD-NNN], and Validates PRD ACs: fields — build TRD_TASKS map
   -      If TRD_TASKS is empty AND TRD is non-empty: print 'WARNING: TRD parsed but no [satisfies] annotations found — TRD may use a different format. Skipping validation.' Skip remaining validation steps and proceed to Scaffold.
   -   c. Check coverage: for each PRD REQ-NNN, check if any TRD task has [satisfies REQ-NNN]; collect UNCOVERED as WARNING
   -   d. Check orphans: for each [satisfies REQ-NNN] in TRD, check if REQ-NNN exists in PRD; collect ORPHANED as ERROR
   -   e. Check test pairs: for each impl task with [satisfies REQ-NNN] (not INFRA/ARCH), check if <task-id>-TEST exists; collect MISSING_TESTS as WARNING
   -   f. AC reference check: for each task in TRD with 'Validates PRD ACs:' field, check if each AC-NNN-M exists in PRD_REQUIREMENTS (i.e., in the flat set of AC-NNN-M IDs extracted from the PRD); collect INVALID_AC_REFS as WARNING
   - Step 4 — Print validation report:
   -   Print '=== TRACEABILITY VALIDATION ==='
   -   Print each WARNING (uncovered reqs, missing -TEST pairs)
   -   Print each ERROR (orphaned annotations)
   -   Print '=============================='
   - Step 5 — HALT decision: if any ERRORS (orphaned annotations) found:
   -   Print 'ERROR: Traceability validation failed. Fix orphaned [satisfies] annotations in TRD before implementing.'
   -   Print 'Run /ensemble:validate-requirements <prd-path> <trd-path> for details.'
   -   HALT
   -   Note: No beads were created. No git operations were performed. Plugin installations from this session are permanent. Re-run after fixing the TRD annotations.
   - Step 6 — If only WARNINGs (no errors): print 'Traceability warnings found but continuing. Address before closing implementation. Run /ensemble:validate-requirements <PRD_PATH> <TRD_PATH> at any time to review warnings.' and proceed to Scaffold

### Phase 2: Scaffold

**1. TRD Parsing**
   Parse TRD into structured phases and tasks

   - Pass 1: Extract TRD_TITLE from first H1 heading
   - Pass 2: Extract TRD_SUMMARY from first prose paragraph (max 500 chars)
   - Pass 3: Extract phases from '### Phase N' or '### Sprint N' headings; synthesize single phase if none found
   - Pass 4: Extract tasks matching '- [ ] **TRD-XXX**: Description' pattern; assign to phases by proximity
   - Pass 5: Validate at least one task found; warn on duplicate task IDs
   - Pass 6: Extract traceability annotations per task — look for [satisfies REQ-NNN] (may also be [satisfies INFRA] or [satisfies ARCH]), [verifies TRD-NNN], 'Validates PRD ACs: AC-NNN-M,...', 'Implementation AC:' block, 'Proof of requirement:' field; store in TASK_TRACEABILITY map keyed by task.id
   - Pass 7: Classify task type — if task.id ends in '-TEST' suffix, mark is_test_task=true; extract verifies_task_id (from [verifies TRD-NNN]) and satisfies_req_id (from [satisfies REQ-NNN]); store in TASK_TRACEABILITY[task.id]

**2. Idempotency Cache**
   Cache existing beads to enable partial scaffold resume via title-prefix matching

   - Run: br list --status=open --json (capture full JSON output once)
   - Parse JSON array of bead objects with .id and .title fields
   - Build EXISTING_BEADS map by matching title prefixes: [trd:<TRD_SLUG>] for epic, [trd:<TRD_SLUG>:phase:<N>] for stories, [trd:<TRD_SLUG>:task:<ID>] for tasks
   - Map key is the title prefix pattern, value is the bead .id
   - Use this cache for all 'already exists' checks during scaffold — do not re-query per bead

**3. Root Epic Creation**
   Create the top-level epic bead for the TRD

   - Check EXISTING_BEADS for title prefix [trd:<TRD_SLUG>]
   - If found: ROOT_EPIC_ID = existing id; skip creation
   - If not found: run br create --title='[trd:<TRD_SLUG>] Implement TRD: <TRD_TITLE>' --type=epic --priority=2 --description='<TRD_SUMMARY>' --json
   - Capture ROOT_EPIC_ID by parsing .id field from JSON response
   - HALT if exit code != 0 or ROOT_EPIC_ID empty

**4. Story Bead Creation**
   Create one story bead per TRD phase under the root epic

   - For each phase i: check EXISTING_BEADS for title prefix [trd:<TRD_SLUG>:phase:<i>]
   - If found: STORY_BEAD_IDs[i] = existing id; skip creation
   - If not found: run br create --title='[trd:<TRD_SLUG>:phase:<i>] Phase <i>: <phase.title>' --type=feature --priority=2 --description='Phase <i> of TRD: <TRD_TITLE>. Contains <task_count> tasks.' --json
   - Capture STORY_BEAD_ID by parsing .id from JSON response
   - After creation: br dep add <STORY_BEAD_ID> <ROOT_EPIC_ID> to establish parent-child relationship
   - HALT if any creation fails

**5. Task Bead Creation**
   Create one task bead per TRD task under its phase story with full description from TRD actions

   - For each task: check EXISTING_BEADS for title prefix [trd:<TRD_SLUG>:task:<task.id>]
   - If found: TASK_BEAD_IDs[i][j] = existing id; record in TRD_TO_BEAD_MAP; skip creation
   - If not found: build structured bead description based on task classification from TASK_TRACEABILITY:
   -   For impl tasks (is_test_task=false): build description as: '## Task: <task.id>\nSatisfies: <satisfies_req_id or INFRA/ARCH>\nPRD ACs: <validates_acs>\nTarget File: <file>\nActions:\n<numbered_actions>\nImplementation AC:\n<implementation_ac_checklist>\nDependencies: <depends_on>'
   -   For test tasks (is_test_task=true): build description as: '## Test Task: <task.id>\nVerifies: <verifies_task_id>\nSatisfies: <satisfies_req_id>\nPRD ACs Proven: <validates_acs>\nProof of requirement: <proof_text>\nTarget Files: <files>\nActions:\n<numbered_actions>\nTest AC:\n<test_ac_checklist>\nDependencies: <depends_on>'
   -   Fallback (task has no [satisfies] annotation AND no [verifies] annotation): use raw TRD task body as description. Tasks with [satisfies INFRA] or [satisfies ARCH] use the impl task format.
   - Run: br create --title='[trd:<TRD_SLUG>:task:<task.id>] <task.description>' --type=task --priority=<task.priority> --description='<structured_bead_description>' --json
   - The description should include: target file path, numbered action items, dependencies, satisfaction/verification links, and acceptance criteria from the TRD task entry
   - Capture TASK_BEAD_ID by parsing .id from JSON response
   - After creation: br dep add <TASK_BEAD_ID> <STORY_BEAD_ID> to establish parent-child relationship
   - Record TRD_TO_BEAD_MAP[task.id] = bead_id for each task

**6. Dependency Encoding**
   Wire explicit TRD dependencies and inter-phase sequential gates

   - For each task with depends_on: br dep add <TASK_BEAD_ID> <TRD_TO_BEAD_MAP[dep_id]> (warn and skip if dep not in map)
   - For each phase i >= 2: br dep add <first_task_of_phase_i> <last_task_of_phase_i-1> (inter-phase sequential gate)

**7. BV Execution Planning**
   Run bv robot-plan and robot-triage for graph-aware execution planning

   - Run: br sync --flush-only (ensure JSONL is current before any bv call)
   - If BV_AVAILABLE == true:
   -   Run: PLAN_OUTPUT=$(bv --robot-plan --format toon) — capture parallel execution tracks
   -   Parse PLAN_OUTPUT to extract parallel tracks (track numbers, task lists per track)
   -   Store PARALLEL_TRACKS for use in wheel instructions
   -   On bv failure: echo 'WARNING: bv --robot-plan failed. Falling back to sequential execution.'; BV_AVAILABLE=false
   -   Run: TRIAGE_OUTPUT=$(bv --robot-triage --format toon) — capture triage analysis
   -   Parse TRIAGE_OUTPUT to extract: quick_ref, recommendations (ranked list with scores), quick_wins, blockers_to_clear
   -   Store TRIAGE_RECOMMENDATIONS for use in wheel instructions
   -   On bv failure: echo 'WARNING: bv --robot-triage failed.'; continue without triage data
   - If BV_AVAILABLE == false: skip bv calls, use br-only sequential execution order

**8. Scaffold Summary and BV Analysis**
   Print scaffolding summary with BV analysis output

   - Print scaffolding summary: epic ID, story count, task count, dep count
   - Run: br list --status=open for summary overview
   - Run: br sync --flush-only (final sync after all scaffold mutations)
   - If BV_AVAILABLE == true:
   -   Print section: === BV ANALYSIS ===
   -   Print PARALLEL EXECUTION TRACKS with parsed track data from PLAN_OUTPUT
   -   Print TRIAGE RECOMMENDATIONS with top recommendations from TRIAGE_OUTPUT
   -   Print QUICK WINS from TRIAGE_OUTPUT quick_wins section
   -   Print BLOCKERS TO CLEAR from TRIAGE_OUTPUT blockers_to_clear section
   - If BV_AVAILABLE == false: print 'BV analysis unavailable. Using br-only execution order.'

**9. Wheel Instructions Output**
   Print agentic coding flywheel instructions for multi-agent execution — team-aware when TEAM_MODE=true. AC: FR-WI-1, FR-WI-2, FR-WI-3, FR-WI-4, AC-WI-1, AC-WI-2

### Phase 3: Execute

**1. Execution Loop**
   Poll bv robot-next (or br ready) and execute tasks until epic is complete. AC: FR-GD-1, FR-GD-2, FR-GD-3, AC-TD-3, AC-BC-1

   - Resume check: If TASK_TRACEABILITY is empty (cross-session resume — Scaffold phase did not run this session), re-parse TRD content to rebuild TASK_TRACEABILITY before processing tasks:
   -   a. Re-run Scaffold Step 1 Pass 6: extract [satisfies REQ-NNN], [satisfies INFRA], [satisfies ARCH], [verifies TRD-NNN], 'Validates PRD ACs:' fields, 'Implementation AC:' blocks, and 'Proof of requirement:' fields per task
   -   b. Re-run Scaffold Step 1 Pass 7: classify task type — if task.id ends in '-TEST' suffix mark is_test_task=true; extract verifies_task_id and satisfies_req_id
   -   c. Store rebuilt map in TASK_TRACEABILITY keyed by task.id
   -   d. Print 'NOTE: TASK_TRACEABILITY rebuilt from TRD (cross-session resume). Tasks: <N>'
   -   e. After rebuild: if rebuilt TASK_TRACEABILITY is empty AND TRD content was successfully read AND TRD is non-empty: print 'WARNING: TRD re-parse found no traceability annotations. Requirement audit comments will not be written. If this is a legacy TRD without [satisfies] annotations, this is expected.' If TRD file could not be read: print 'ERROR: Cannot read TRD file at <TRD_PATH> during cross-session resume. Verify file exists and is readable.' and HALT.
   - TEAM_MODE Gate (evaluated once at the start of the Execute phase):
   -   if TEAM_MODE == false:
   -     - Use the existing v2.1.0 Execute loop (all steps 1-6 unchanged)
   -     - Skip all team-specific steps (reviewer delegation, QA delegation, rejection loop, parallel builders)
   -     - Quality Gate phase: run full scope (current behavior)
   -     - Continue to LOOP below
   -   if TEAM_MODE == true:
   -     - Replace the standard execution loop with the Lead Orchestration Loop below (TRD-013, AC: FR-LL-1, AC-LL-1)
   -     - Reviewer delegation: enabled (TRD-016)
   -     - QA delegation: enabled if QA_ENABLED=true (TRD-017)
   -     - Parallel builder slots: active (TRD-025)
   -     - Quality Gate phase: reduced scope if QA_ENABLED=true (TRD-031)
   -     - Note: Scaffold phase is IDENTICAL in both modes (no team awareness in scaffold)
   -     - Note: Completion phase is IDENTICAL in both modes
   -     - Note: v2.1.0 beads without status: comments are treated as in_progress (builder stage) — safe default for backward compat (TRD-038)
   -     - RETURN (team loop handles all remaining execution; skip LOOP below)
   - 
   -     LEAD ORCHESTRATION LOOP (TEAM_MODE=true):
   - 
   -     Variables: active_builders = {} (bead_id -> builder_agent)
   - 
   -     LOOP:
   -       1. br sync --flush-only (ensure JSONL current)
   - 
   -       2. Check in-flight tasks (tasks with br native status=in_progress that have sub-states in_review or in_qa):
   -          - Run: br list --status=in_progress --json, filter by TRD slug
   -          - For each in-progress bead: call get_sub_state(bead_id)
   -            - If sub_state == 'in_review': proceed to Reviewer Delegation step (TRD-016)
   -            - If sub_state == 'in_qa': proceed to QA Delegation step (TRD-017)
   -            - If sub_state == 'in_progress': task is with builder (normal)
   - 
   -       3. Count available slots: available_slots = max_parallel - len(active_builders)
   -          (default max_parallel=1, increased by 'max parallel N' argument)
   - 
   -       4. If available_slots > 0:
   -          - Get next tasks: if BV_AVAILABLE, run bv --robot-next --format toon (returns top unblocked task)
   -            Else: run br ready, filter by [trd:<TRD_SLUG>:task:] prefix
   -          - For each task (up to available_slots):
   -            a. (TRD-021) Architecture Review: check task description for keywords:
   -               'architecture', 'design', 'system', 'cross-cutting', 'multi-component', 'orchestrat'
   -               If ANY keyword found:
   -                 - Lead performs brief architectural review (read TRD context, consider phase impact)
   -                 - Generate guidance notes (key design decisions, patterns to use, pitfalls to avoid)
   -                 - Record: br comment add <bead_id> 'architecture-review lead:<agent> guidance:<url_encoded_summary>'
   -                 - Include guidance in builder prompt: 'Architecture guidance from lead: <guidance_notes>'
   -               If NO keywords: skip architecture review, proceed normally
   -            b. (TRD-020) Lead Skip Decision: evaluate task characteristics before delegating to builder:
   -               - If task description contains ONLY documentation/comments (no code changes expected):
   -                 SKIP_REVIEW=true, SKIP_QA=true
   -               - If REVIEWER_ENABLED=false: SKIP_REVIEW=true (per TRD-023)
   -               - If QA_ENABLED=false: SKIP_QA=true (per TRD-023)
   -               - Lead can also skip based on judgment (low-risk configuration, etc.)
   -               Record skip decisions:
   -               - If SKIP_REVIEW: br comment add <bead_id> 'status:skip-review lead:<agent> reason:<rationale>'
   -               - If SKIP_QA: br comment add <bead_id> 'status:skip-qa lead:<agent> reason:<rationale>'
   -               Transition directly:
   -               - Both review and QA skipped: validate_transition(bead_id, 'closed') directly after builder
   -               - Only review skipped: validate_transition(bead_id, 'in_qa') -> QA delegation after builder
   -               - No skips: normal flow (in_progress -> in_review -> in_qa -> closed)
   -               AC: FR-LL-6, FR-LL-7, FR-LL-10, AC-LL-3, AC-LL-4, AC-LL-5, AC-LL-6
   -            c. (TRD-022) Sibling Task Context: collect completed sibling tasks in same phase:
   -               - Query br list --status=closed --json, filter by [trd:<TRD_SLUG>:phase:<N>] prefix
   -               - For each closed task in this phase: read br comment list, find last implementation summary
   -               - Limit to 5 most recently closed siblings
   -               - If sibling context found, add to builder prompt:
   -                 'Previously completed tasks in this phase:'
   -                 '[TRD-XXX]: <implementation_summary_first_200_chars>'
   -                 '[TRD-YYY]: <implementation_summary_first_200_chars>'
   -               - If no siblings completed yet: omit this section from prompt
   -               AC: FR-LL-9
   -            d. Select builder from TEAM_ROLES.builder.agents using keyword matching (TRD-014)
   -            e. validate_transition(bead_id, 'in_progress') -- write status comment
   -            f. Delegate to builder via Task(subagent_type=<builder>, prompt=<builder_prompt>) (TRD-015)
   -            g. active_builders[bead_id] = builder
   - 
   -       --- Parallel Builder Execution (TRD-025) ---
   -       When available_slots > 1 AND multiple tasks are ready, apply parallel dispatch:
   - 
   -       TRD-025-1. Set BUILDER_SLOTS = max_parallel (default 1, overridden by 'max parallel N' argument)
   - 
   -       TRD-025-2. Query available tasks for parallel dispatch:
   -          - If BV_AVAILABLE: run bv --robot-plan --format toon to get parallel execution tracks
   -            Extract up to BUILDER_SLOTS tasks from the top-priority track(s)
   -          - Else: run br ready, filter by [trd:<TRD_SLUG>:task:] prefix, take up to BUILDER_SLOTS entries
   -          - Candidate task list: CANDIDATE_TASKS = up to BUILDER_SLOTS ready tasks
   - 
   -       TRD-025-3. File conflict detection: prevent assigning tasks with overlapping file targets
   -          - For each task in CANDIDATE_TASKS:
   -            a. Extract target file paths from the bead description
   -               (look for 'File:', file path patterns like src/*, and file mentions in action items)
   -            b. Build FILE_MAP: task_id -> [file_path, ...]
   -          - Build SEEN_FILES = {} (file_path -> first task_id that claims it)
   -          - Iterate CANDIDATE_TASKS in order:
   -            For each task: check if ANY of its file paths are already in SEEN_FILES
   -              - If NO overlap: add task to CONFLICT_FREE set, add its files to SEEN_FILES
   -              - If overlap found: discard this task (keep first occurrence); log discarded task_id
   -          - CONFLICT_FREE = ordered list of tasks with no file overlaps (up to BUILDER_SLOTS)
   - 
   -       TRD-025-4. Launch concurrent Task() delegations for CONFLICT_FREE task set:
   -          Phase A — Pre-flight (sequential, per task):
   -            For each task in CONFLICT_FREE: run steps 4a-4e (architecture review, skip decision,
   -              sibling context, builder selection, validate_transition) to prepare builder prompt.
   -          Phase B — Concurrent dispatch:
   -            Issue all Task() calls (step 4f) for CONFLICT_FREE simultaneously (parallel invocation).
   -            Each builder works independently on its assigned task.
   -          Phase C — Post-dispatch bookkeeping (sequential, per task):
   -            For each dispatched task: run step 4g (active_builders[bead_id] = builder).
   - 
   -       TRD-025-5. Wait for all parallel builders to complete:
   -          - Block until ALL concurrent Task() delegations from TRD-025-4 return results
   -          - Collect structured builder summaries (files_changed, implementation_description, etc.)
   - 
   -       TRD-025-6. Process each builder result sequentially (after all parallel builders finish):
   -          - For each completed builder result in CONFLICT_FREE order:
   -            a. On builder success: run Reviewer Delegation step (step 3a) for this task
   -            b. On reviewer approval: run QA Delegation step (step 3b) for this task
   -            c. On any rejection: run Rejection Loop (step 3c) for this task
   -            (Review and QA remain sequential per task even when builders ran in parallel)
   -          - Remove each completed task from active_builders after its full pipeline finishes
   - 
   -       --- Sequential Commit Ordering (TRD-026) ---
   -       When parallel builders complete and their full pipelines (review+QA) pass, the lead serializes git commit operations:
   - 
   -       TRD-026-1. Maintain COMMIT_QUEUE = ordered list of tasks whose pipelines completed successfully (in completion order).
   - 
   -       TRD-026-2. For each task in COMMIT_QUEUE (process one at a time):
   -          a. Run: git diff --name-only HEAD to see current staged changes
   -          b. If no file conflicts with prior commits in this batch: commit immediately
   -             - git commit with message referencing task ID and bead ID
   -             - br comment add <bead_id> 'commit-order:<N> commit:<sha>'
   -             - N = position in COMMIT_QUEUE (1-indexed)
   -          c. If file conflict detected (same file modified by prior commit):
   -             - One retry: builder re-applies its changes on top of the current HEAD
   -             - If retry succeeds: commit normally, record commit-order:<N>
   -             - If retry fails: br update <bead_id> --status=open; br comment add <bead_id> 'status:open commit-conflict-unresolved: returned to open'; continue to next task in COMMIT_QUEUE
   - 
   -       TRD-026-3. After all commits: br sync --flush-only
   - 
   -       --- Parallel Builder Failure Isolation (TRD-027) ---
   -       If one builder fails (Task() returns error or structured failure summary) during parallel execution:
   - 
   -       TRD-027-1. Reset that task: br update <bead_id> --status=open
   - 
   -       TRD-027-2. Record failure (pure audit record — no state prefix): br comment add <bead_id> 'verdict:failed builder:<agent_type> reason:<error_summary>'
   -          Note: NO status: prefix — this is a failure audit comment, not a state transition. validate_transition is NOT called.
   -          The bead is already open (reset in step 1); a status: prefix would mislead get_sub_state() on the next loop iteration.
   - 
   -       TRD-027-3. Other parallel builders continue unaffected (do not interrupt them).
   - 
   -       TRD-027-4. The failed task enters the debug loop (Execute step 5: Debug Loop) on the NEXT loop iteration OR is eligible for re-assignment to another builder.
   - 
   -       TRD-027-5. Lead tracks builder slot count: when a builder fails, its slot is freed immediately (active_builders count decremented).
   - 
   -       TRD-027-6. Lead refills available slots on the next loop iteration by querying bv --robot-next / br ready again.
   - 
   -       5. Check loop exit:
   -          - If no tasks returned by bv/br AND no active_builders AND no in-flight tasks: break to Completion
   -          - If no tasks returned but tasks exist in_review or in_qa: wait (check in-flight tasks next iteration)
   - 
   -       6. br sync --flush-only
   -       7. Continue LOOP
   - LOOP:
   - Run: br sync --flush-only (ensure JSONL current before bv call)
   - If BV_AVAILABLE: run bv --robot-next --format toon to get single top-priority task
   - If not BV_AVAILABLE: run br ready, filter by title prefix [trd:<TRD_SLUG>:task:]
   - If no tasks returned: run br list --status=open --json filtered by TRD slug; if no open tasks remain break to Completion; else PAUSE (possible dependency cycle)
   - If max_parallel==1 or single task ready: execute_single_task
   - Else: if BV_AVAILABLE use bv --robot-plan --format toon for parallel tracks; take up to max_parallel candidates; run file conflict detection; execute conflict-free group in parallel
   - After each task (or parallel group): br sync --flush-only, then if BV_AVAILABLE run bv --robot-triage --format toon for progress check else run br list --status=open filtered by TRD slug

**2. Task Claim and Specialist Selection**
   Claim task in beads before delegating to specialist agent

   - Run: br update <BEAD_ID> --status=in_progress — skip task if exit code != 0 (already claimed)
   - Extract TASK_ID from task.title prefix (TRD-XXX pattern)
   - Select specialist by keyword matching: architecture/design/system/multi-component/cross-cutting/orchestrat -> @tech-lead-orchestrator; backend/api/endpoint/database/server/model/migration -> @backend-developer; frontend/ui/component/react/vue/angular/svelte/css -> @frontend-developer; test/spec/e2e/playwright/coverage -> @test-runner or @playwright-tester; docs/readme/documentation/changelog/api-docs -> @documentation-specialist; infra/deploy/docker/k8s/kubernetes/aws/cloud/terraform -> @infrastructure-developer; refactor/optimize/cleanup spanning multiple domains -> @tech-lead-orchestrator; default -> @backend-developer
   - Check .claude/router-rules.json first; project-specific agents take priority over keyword defaults
   - Match skills via router-rules.json triggers/patterns; fallback: jest/pytest/rspec/exunit/xunit by language keywords
   - 
   - TRD-014 — Builder Agent Constraint from Team Config (AC: FR-TD-5):
   - When TEAM_MODE=true, add this constraint to specialist selection:
   -   - Run standard keyword matching (existing logic above)
   -   - But constrain candidates to TEAM_ROLES.builder.agents list only
   -   - If keyword match selects agent NOT in team builder list: fall back to first agent in TEAM_ROLES.builder.agents
   -   - .claude/router-rules.json takes priority over both keyword defaults AND team constraint
   -   - Example: keyword says @infrastructure-developer, team builder list has [backend-developer, frontend-developer]
   -     -> fall back to backend-developer (first in list)
   - When TEAM_MODE=false: existing specialist selection unchanged

**3. Task Delegation**
   Build prompt and delegate to selected specialist, require closing summary comment

   - Build prompt with: Task ID + bead ID, TRD file path, strategy, constitution targets, completed tasks this phase, acceptance criteria, inferred file paths, matched skills, strategy-specific instructions
   - Include in prompt: 'When done, provide a structured summary: files changed, what was implemented, any issues encountered, and recommendations for follow-up work.'
   - Delegate: Task(agent_type=<specialist>, prompt=<prompt>)
   - On success: br comment add <BEAD_ID> 'Implementation complete: <agent_summary_of_work_done — files changed, what was implemented, any issues or recommendations>'; proceed to Code Review step
   - On failure: br comment add <BEAD_ID> 'Failed: <error_summary>. Files touched: <changed_files>. Agent: <specialist_type>.'; br update <BEAD_ID> --status=open; br sync --flush-only; enter debug loop
   - 
   - TRD-015 — Builder Delegation with Structured Output (AC: FR-BA-1, FR-BA-2, FR-BA-3, FR-BA-4, FR-BA-5, AC-SM-1):
   - When TEAM_MODE=true, builder delegation differs:
   -   1. Builder prompt includes additional instruction:
   -      'IMPORTANT: Do NOT close this bead (do not run br close). When done, return a structured summary:'
   -      '  - files_changed: [list of modified files with paths]'
   -      '  - implementation_description: [what was implemented]'
   -      '  - test_results: [pass/fail with details]'
   -      '  - issues_encountered: [list of problems, empty if none]'
   -      '  - recommendations: [follow-up suggestions, empty if none]'
   -   2. Delegate: Task(subagent_type=<builder>, prompt=<augmented_prompt>)
   -   3. On success:
   -      a. Extract files_changed from builder's structured summary
   -      b. Run: br comment add <bead_id> 'status:in_review builder:<agent> files:<comma-joined-files_changed>'
   -      c. validate_transition(bead_id, 'in_review') -- see Execute step 9 (State Machine Transition Validator)
   -      d. Proceed to Reviewer Delegation (TRD-016, Execute step 3a)
   -   4. On failure (builder crashes, not rejection):
   -      a. br comment add <bead_id> 'Implementation failed: <error_summary>. Builder: <agent>.'
   -      b. Enter debug loop (Execute step 5)
   - When TEAM_MODE=false: existing Task Delegation step unchanged (builder can close bead)

**3a. Reviewer Delegation and Verdict Handling (TEAM_MODE=true only)**
   Delegate to reviewer after builder submits, parse verdict, route accordingly. AC: FR-CR-1, FR-CR-2, FR-CR-3, FR-CR-4, FR-CR-5, FR-CR-6, FR-LL-3, FR-SM-5, AC-SM-3

   - TRD-016 — Reviewer Delegation and Verdict Handling (TEAM_MODE=true only, after builder writes status:in_review comment):
   - 
   - 1. Build reviewer prompt:
   -    - Bead ID and task title
   -    - Files changed (from builder's structured summary)
   -    - Builder's implementation_description
   -    - TRD acceptance criteria for this specific task (from bead description)
   -    - Strategy and coverage targets
   -    - Relevant test results from builder summary
   -    - Instruction: 'Review the implementation. Return verdict: APPROVED or REJECTED.'
   -      'If REJECTED: provide specific feedback with file, line, issue, and suggestion.'
   - 
   - 2. Delegate: Task(subagent_type=<TEAM_ROLES.reviewer.agents[0]>, prompt=<reviewer_prompt>)
   - 
   - 3. Parse reviewer response:
   -    - Look for 'APPROVED' or 'REJECTED' keyword in response
   -    - Extract rejection reason if REJECTED
   - 
   - 4. On APPROVED:
   -    - validate_transition(bead_id, 'in_qa')  -- sole status comment writer: writes 'status:in_qa reviewer:<agent> verdict:approved' and calls br comment add internally
   -    - Proceed to QA Delegation (TRD-017)
   - 
   - 5. On REJECTED:
   -    - validate_transition(bead_id, 'in_progress')  -- sole status comment writer: writes 'status:in_progress reviewer:<agent> verdict:rejected reason:<url_encoded_reason>' and resets native br status to open
   -    - Increment rejection count for this bead
   -    - Re-delegate to builder with rejection context (TRD-018 rejection loop)
   - 
   - 6. Track: record reviewer_agent for this task in metrics (TRD-034)

**3b. QA Delegation and Verdict Handling (TEAM_MODE=true only)**
   Delegate to QA agent after reviewer approves and task is in_qa state, parse verdict, route accordingly. AC: FR-QA-1, FR-QA-2, FR-QA-3, FR-QA-4, FR-QA-5, FR-QA-6, FR-LL-4, FR-SM-6, AC-SM-1

   - TRD-017 — QA Delegation and Verdict Handling (TEAM_MODE=true only, invoked when task sub-state == 'in_qa'):
   - 
   - 1. Build QA prompt:
   -    - Bead ID and task title
   -    - Files changed (from builder's structured summary)
   -    - Builder's implementation_description
   -    - Reviewer's verdict (approved) and any notes from reviewer response
   -    - TRD acceptance criteria for this specific task (from bead description)
   -    - Strategy and coverage targets (from strategy detection)
   -    - Test results from builder's summary
   - 
   - 2. Delegate to @test-runner first for fresh test execution:
   -    Task(subagent_type='test-runner', prompt='Run tests for changed files: <files_changed>. Report pass/fail and coverage.')
   -    Capture test_results from @test-runner response.
   - 
   - 3. Build augmented QA prompt with test_results, then:
   -    Before accessing TASK_TRACEABILITY[TASK_ID]: if TASK_ID is not present as a key in the TASK_TRACEABILITY map (task predates traceability or map rebuild failed): print 'WARNING: No traceability entry for <TASK_ID> — treating as impl task; audit tokens will not be written. If this task has [satisfies REQ-NNN] annotations, re-run this command to re-scaffold.' Set is_test_task = false and skip all req-satisfied/req-verified/ac-proven token writing for this task.
   -    Check TASK_TRACEABILITY[TASK_ID].is_test_task:
   -    If is_test_task == true: append to QA prompt before delegating:
   -      'IMPORTANT: For each PRD AC listed in Validates PRD ACs:, provide explicit verdict (PROVEN/NOT_PROVEN) with evidence.'
   -    Delegate: Task(subagent_type=<TEAM_ROLES.qa.agents[0]>, prompt=<qa_prompt_with_test_results>)
   - 
   -    QA agent validates:
   -    - All acceptance criteria from TRD are met
   -    - Test coverage meets strategy targets
   -    - No regressions in existing tests
   -    - Code quality and security concerns (if any)
   - 
   -    QA returns verdict: PASSED or REJECTED with specific issues.
   - 
   - 4. Parse QA response for PASSED/REJECTED keyword.
   - 
   - 5. On PASSED:
   -    a. Detect if this is a test task: before accessing TASK_TRACEABILITY[TASK_ID]: if TASK_ID is not present as a key in the TASK_TRACEABILITY map (task predates traceability or map rebuild failed): print 'WARNING: No traceability entry for <TASK_ID> — treating as impl task; audit tokens will not be written. If this task has [satisfies REQ-NNN] annotations, re-run this command to re-scaffold.' Set is_test_task = false and skip all req-satisfied/req-verified/ac-proven token writing for this task. Otherwise: check TASK_TRACEABILITY[TASK_ID].is_test_task
   -    b. If test task: parse QA response for per-AC verdicts (the prompt already required PROVEN/NOT_PROVEN per AC from step 3 above);
   -       build PROVEN_ACS list of AC-NNN-M IDs with verdict=PROVEN
   -       Extract REQ_ID from TASK_TRACEABILITY[TASK_ID].satisfies_req_id
   -    c. validate_transition(bead_id, 'closed') — writes augmented status comment for test tasks:
   -       If test task: 'status:closed qa:<agent> verdict:passed req-satisfied:<REQ_ID> ac-proven:<PROVEN_ACS comma-joined>'
   -       If impl task: 'status:closed qa:<agent> verdict:passed' (existing behavior)
   -    d. If test task AND PASSED: write root epic audit comment:
   -       br comment add <ROOT_EPIC_ID> 'req-verified:<REQ_ID> by:<TASK_ID> qa:<QA_AGENT> ac-proven:<PROVEN_ACS comma-joined>'
   -    e. Run: br sync --flush-only
   -    f. Update TRD checkbox: replace '- [ ] **<TASK_ID>**' with '- [x] **<TASK_ID>**' in TRD file
   -    g. git commit -m 'feat(<TRD_SLUG>): complete <TASK_ID> - <task_title_short>'
   -    h. Record metrics: update TEAM_METRICS accumulator (TRD-034, Execute step 3d)
   - 
   - 6. On REJECTED:
   -    a. validate_transition(bead_id, 'in_progress')  -- sole status comment writer: writes 'status:in_progress qa:<agent> verdict:rejected reason:<url_encoded_reason>' and resets native br status to open
   -    b. Run: br update <bead_id> --status=open (ensure br native status is reset for re-claiming)
   -    c. Increment rejection count for this bead
   -    d. Return to builder with QA feedback (via rejection loop TRD-018, Execute step 3c):
   -       - Include: QA rejection reason, failed acceptance criteria, test failure details
   -       - Builder re-implements, then goes back through reviewer -> QA
   - 
   - 7. Track: record qa_agent for this task in metrics (TRD-034)

**3c. Rejection Loop with Builder Re-Delegation (TEAM_MODE=true only)**
   Triggered by reviewer REJECTED (from step 3a) or QA REJECTED (from step 3b). Collects full rejection context, enforces MAX_REJECTIONS cap, and re-delegates to the original builder or escalates to lead. AC: FR-LL-5, AC-SM-3, AC-SM-4

   - TRD-018 — Rejection Loop with Builder Re-Delegation (TEAM_MODE=true, triggered by reviewer OR QA REJECTED verdict):
   - 
   - 1. Collect full rejection context from br comments:
   -    - Run: br comment list <bead_id>
   -    - Extract ALL verdict:rejected comments (not just the latest)
   -    - Build rejection_context = {
   -        rejection_count: <count of lines containing verdict:rejected>,
   -        latest_reason: <url_decoded reason from most recent verdict:rejected comment>,
   -        previous_attempts: <summaries of builder implementation from prior builder comments>,
   -        reviewer_feedback: <specific reviewer issues if rejection source is reviewer (step 3a)>,
   -        qa_feedback: <specific QA issues including failed ACs and test failures if rejection source is QA (step 3b)>
   -      }
   - 
   - 2. Check rejection_count against MAX_REJECTIONS (default 2):
   -    a. If rejection_count < MAX_REJECTIONS:
   -       - Identify original builder from the bead's assigned: metadata in the first status:in_progress comment
   -         (Run: br comment list <bead_id>, scan forward for first 'status:in_progress assigned:<agent>' comment)
   -       - Re-delegate to SAME original builder:
   -         Task(subagent_type=<original_builder>, prompt=<augmented_re_delegation_prompt>)
   -       - Augmented re-delegation prompt includes:
   -         'IMPORTANT: Your previous implementation was rejected. You must address ALL issues before resubmitting.'
   -         'Rejection reason: <latest_reason>'
   -         'Reviewer feedback: <reviewer_feedback if rejection from reviewer, else N/A>'
   -         'QA feedback: <qa_feedback if rejection from QA, else N/A>'
   -         'Previous attempt summary: <what was tried in prior implementation>'
   -         'Please fix ALL identified issues. Do NOT close the bead — return a structured summary as before.'
   -       - After builder returns: continue through full pipeline (step 3a reviewer -> step 3b QA again)
   - 
   -    b. If rejection_count >= MAX_REJECTIONS:
   -       - LEAD ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW (TRD-007 escalation):
   -         Lead reviews all of: task description (from bead description), all rejection reasons
   -         (from br comment list), builder implementation attempts (from builder status comments),
   -         and acceptance criteria (from bead description).
   -         Lead decision options (choose one):
   -           - Restructure task: break into smaller sub-tasks, create new child beads under same story
   -           - Adjust acceptance criteria: if criteria are overly strict or misspecified for scope
   -           - Reassign: delegate to a different builder from TEAM_ROLES.builder.agents list
   -           - Architectural fix: identify root architectural issue requiring a fundamentally different approach
   -         Record lead decision:
   -           br comment add <bead_id> 'lead-escalation:max-rejections lead:tech-lead-orchestrator action:<decision>'
   -         Reset rejection baseline:
   -           Write a new 'status:in_progress assigned:<builder> lead-reset:true' comment.
   -           Subsequent rejection counts are relative to comments AFTER this new baseline comment.
   -         Allow one more full cycle (builder -> reviewer -> QA) with lead guidance included in builder prompt:
   -           'Lead architectural guidance after escalation: <lead_decision_and_rationale>'
   -         If still failing after the post-escalation cycle:
   -           PAUSE for user decision (abort task, force-close with known issues, or escalate further)
   - 
   - 3. All rejection history from br comments is included in re-delegation prompt.
   -    Agents have full audit trail context from previous cycles via br comment list output.

**3d. Team Metrics Collection (TEAM_MODE=true only)**
   In-memory metrics accumulator invoked after each task closure in step 3b PASSED path. Tracks per-builder stats, rejection cycles, and time-in-state for the current phase. AC: FR-TM-1, FR-TM-2, FR-TM-3, AC-TM-4

   - TRD-034 — Team Metrics Collection (TEAM_MODE=true, invoked after each task closure in step 3b PASSED path):
   - 
   - Initialization (once at Execute phase start when TEAM_MODE=true):
   -   TEAM_METRICS = {
   -     phase: <current_phase_number>,
   -     tasks_completed: 0,
   -     builders: {},   # per-builder stats: {agent_name: {tasks, first_pass_approvals, rejections}}
   -     task_details: []  # per-task metrics entries
   -   }
   - 
   - After each task closure (step 3b PASSED path):
   - 
   - 1. Identify builder agent:
   -    - Run: br comment list <bead_id>
   -    - Scan forward for the first (or most recent post-lead-reset) 'status:in_progress assigned:<agent>' comment
   -    - Extract builder_agent name from the assigned: value
   - 
   - 2. Count rejection cycles:
   -    - From the same br comment list output, count lines containing the exact token 'verdict:rejected'
   -    - rejection_cycles = count of such lines
   - 
   - 3. Extract timestamps from br comments to calculate time in each sub-state:
   -    - Scan br comment list output for status transition comments with timestamps
   -    - time_in_progress: timestamp(first status:in_review comment) - timestamp(status:in_progress comment)
   -    - time_in_review:   timestamp(status:in_qa comment) - timestamp(status:in_review comment)
   -    - time_in_qa:       timestamp(status:closed comment) - timestamp(status:in_qa comment)
   -    - If a stage was skipped (status:skip-review or status:skip-qa present): time for that stage = 0
   -    - If timestamps are unavailable or unparse-able: record as null (do not fail metrics collection)
   - 
   - 4. Determine first_pass_approval:
   -    - first_pass_approval = true if rejection_cycles == 0, else false
   - 
   - 5. Update TEAM_METRICS:
   -    - TEAM_METRICS.tasks_completed += 1
   -    - If builder_agent NOT in TEAM_METRICS.builders: initialize entry
   -      TEAM_METRICS.builders[builder_agent] = {tasks: 0, first_pass_approvals: 0, rejections: 0}
   -    - TEAM_METRICS.builders[builder_agent].tasks += 1
   -    - If first_pass_approval: TEAM_METRICS.builders[builder_agent].first_pass_approvals += 1
   -    - TEAM_METRICS.builders[builder_agent].rejections += rejection_cycles
   -    - TEAM_METRICS.task_details.append({
   -        id: <bead_id>,
   -        task_id: <TRD-XXX from title>,
   -        builder: builder_agent,
   -        rejection_cycles: rejection_cycles,
   -        time_in_progress: time_in_progress,
   -        time_in_review: time_in_review,
   -        time_in_qa: time_in_qa,
   -        first_pass_approval: first_pass_approval
   -      })
   - 
   - Note: TEAM_METRICS lives in-memory for the duration of the Execute phase.
   - At Quality Gate phase completion (step 3 of Quality Gate), include TEAM_METRICS summary
   - in the gate result comment if TEAM_MODE=true:
   -   br comment add <STORY_BEAD_ID> 'team-metrics phase:<N> tasks:<tasks_completed>
   -     first-pass-rate:<X%> total-rejections:<Y>'

**4. Code Review**
   Mandatory code review before task closure — delegate to @code-reviewer for quality validation

   - Delegate to @code-reviewer: 'Review the changes for task <TASK_ID> (bead: <BEAD_ID>). Files changed: <changed_files>. Strategy: <strategy>. Check for: correctness, adherence to project conventions, security issues, test coverage, and code quality. Provide: approval/rejection with specific feedback.'
   - If approved:
   -   br comment add <BEAD_ID> 'Code review PASSED by @code-reviewer: <review_summary>'
   -   Before accessing TASK_TRACEABILITY[TASK_ID]: if TASK_ID is not present as a key in the TASK_TRACEABILITY map (task predates traceability or map rebuild failed): print 'WARNING: No traceability entry for <TASK_ID> — treating as impl task; audit tokens will not be written. If this task has [satisfies REQ-NNN] annotations, re-run this command to re-scaffold.' Set is_test_task = false and skip all req-satisfied/req-verified/ac-proven token writing for this task.
   -   Check TASK_TRACEABILITY[TASK_ID].is_test_task:
   -   If is_test_task == true:
   -     Extract REQ_ID from TASK_TRACEABILITY[TASK_ID].satisfies_req_id
   -     Extract PROVEN_ACS from TASK_TRACEABILITY[TASK_ID].validates_acs (all ACs for this test task)
   -     Write the status:closed comment with embedded req-satisfied token: run `br close <BEAD_ID>` then write bead comment: `br comment add <BEAD_ID> 'status:closed reviewer:code-reviewer verdict:approved req-satisfied:<REQ_ID> ac-proven:<PROVEN_ACS comma-joined>'`
   -     Write root epic comment: br comment add <ROOT_EPIC_ID> 'req-verified:<REQ_ID> by:<TASK_ID> reviewer:code-reviewer ac-proven:<PROVEN_ACS comma-joined>'
   -     Note: In TEAM_MODE=false, code review approval triggers audit token writing. The 'reviewer:code-reviewer' field in the comment distinguishes this from QA-verified evidence. The Completion Report will show these as SATISFIED(code-review) to distinguish from SATISFIED(qa-verified).
   -     br sync --flush-only; update TRD checkbox - [ ] -> - [x]; git commit
   -   If is_test_task == false:
   -   br close <BEAD_ID> --reason='Completed — code review passed'; br sync --flush-only; update TRD checkbox - [ ] -> - [x]; git commit
   - If rejected with fixable issues: br comment add <BEAD_ID> 'Code review REJECTED: <issues_found>'; delegate back to original specialist with review feedback; re-submit to code review after fixes (max 2 review rounds)
   - If rejected after 2 rounds: br comment add <BEAD_ID> 'Code review failed after 2 rounds. Issues: <remaining_issues>.'; PAUSE for user decision (force-close, fix manually, abort)
   - Skip code review only if strategy == 'flexible' or task type is docs/documentation-only

**5. Debug Loop**
   Attempt automated fix on task failure via deep-debugger (max 2 retries)

   - Delegate to @deep-debugger with error details, changed files, strategy, bead ID
   - If fix applied: re-run tests; if pass -> proceed to Code Review step (order 4); if fail -> retry
   - After 2 retries: br comment add <BEAD_ID> 'Debug loop exhausted after 2 retries. Root cause: <error_analysis>. Attempted fixes: <fix_attempts>. Manual intervention required.'; br sync --flush-only; PAUSE for user decision
   - 
   - TRD-019 — Debug Loop Integration for Team Mode (AC: FR-IT-5, AC-LL-2):
   - When TEAM_MODE=true and builder fails with an actual error (not rejection -- crash/exception):
   -   1. Enter debug loop same as v2.1.0 (delegate to @deep-debugger with error details, changed files)
   -   2. Record debug attempt: br comment add <bead_id> 'debug-attempt:<N> debugger:deep-debugger error:<summary>'
   -   3. If fix applied: re-run through builder (Task(builder, re-implementation prompt))
   -      Then continue through handoff pipeline: reviewer -> QA
   -   4. After 2 debug retries without success:
   -      br comment add <bead_id> 'Debug loop exhausted after 2 retries. Manual intervention required.'
   -      PAUSE for user decision (same as v2.1.0)
   - When TEAM_MODE=false: existing debug loop unchanged

**6. Error Handling**
   Handle br command failures during execution

   - After any br command: if exit code != 0 AND prior br commands in session succeeded -> possible br failure
   - Print error message with br command that failed and its exit code
   - Print: check br status and .beads/ directory integrity
   - PAUSE for user decision (resume with /ensemble:implement-trd-beads <trd-path> after issue resolved)

**7. Utility: Sub-State Query Function (get_sub_state)**
   Inline utility referenced by the State Machine Transition Validator (order 8) and by resume logic. Reads br comment history in reverse to find the most recent status: comment. AC: FR-SM-2, FR-BR-2, AC-BR-2

   - Function signature: get_sub_state(bead_id) -> (state, metadata_dict)
   - Step 1: Run: br comment list <bead_id>  — capture full output as COMMENT_LIST
   - Step 2: Split COMMENT_LIST into individual lines
   - Step 3: Scan lines in REVERSE ORDER (last line first; last comment is most recent)
   - Step 4: For each line, check if the line STARTS WITH the exact prefix 'status:' (not merely contains it)
   - Step 5 — If a matching line is found:
   -   a. Extract state: first whitespace-delimited token after 'status:' (e.g., 'in_progress', 'in_review', 'in_qa', 'closed')
   -   b. Extract metadata: remaining space-separated 'key:value' tokens on the same line
   -   c. URL-decode any 'reason:' values: replace '%20' with space and '+' with space
   -   d. Return (state, {key: value, ...})
   - Step 6 — Edge cases during line scan:
   -   - Malformed comment where 'status:' prefix is present but no state token follows: skip that line and continue scanning
   -   - Multiple rapid status comments: reverse scan naturally returns the most recent — correct behavior
   -   - Empty comment list: falls through to Step 7 (native status lookup)
   - Step 7 — If NO 'status:' comment found in entire list (fallback to br native status):
   -   Run: br list --json, filter JSON array for the entry where .id == bead_id, read .status field
   -   Map native status to sub-state:
   -     'open'        -> return ('open', {})
   -     'in_progress' -> return ('in_progress', {})
   -     'closed'      -> return ('closed', {})
   -     any other     -> return (native_status_value, {})

**8. Utility: Rejection Cycle Tracking and Cap**
   Inline utility invoked after any verdict:rejected comment is written during reviewer or QA delegation. Enforces a maximum rejection cap and escalates to lead when the cap is reached. AC: FR-SM-7, AC-SM-4

   - Rejection Cycle Tracking (invoked during reviewer and QA delegation, after each verdict:rejected comment):
   - Step 1 — Count rejection cycles for this bead (respecting lead-reset baseline):
   -   Run: br comment list <bead_id>  — capture full output as COMMENT_LINES (ordered oldest to newest)
   -   1a. Scan all of COMMENT_LINES (oldest to newest, index 0 upward), updating BASELINE_LINE_INDEX each time a line containing 'lead-reset:true' is encountered.
   -       After the full scan: BASELINE_LINE_INDEX holds the index of the MOST RECENT such line.
   -       If no such line was found: BASELINE_LINE_INDEX = -1 (no baseline; count all comments).
   -   1b. Count lines containing the exact token 'verdict:rejected' in COMMENT_LINES[BASELINE_LINE_INDEX+1:]
   -       (i.e., only comments appearing AFTER the baseline comment, or all comments if no baseline).
   -   REJECTION_COUNT = number of matching lines found in the post-baseline slice
   - Step 2 — Determine cap:
   -   MAX_REJECTIONS = 2 (default)
   -   If team config contains a max_rejections: field for this role: override MAX_REJECTIONS with that value
   - Step 3 — If REJECTION_COUNT < MAX_REJECTIONS:
   -   Return task to builder with full rejection context:
   -     - Include: rejection reason from verdict:rejected comment, all reviewer/QA feedback from comments, list of previous attempt summaries
   -   Continue normal rejection loop (builder re-implements, re-submits)
   - Step 4 — If REJECTION_COUNT >= MAX_REJECTIONS, escalate to lead for architectural review:
   -   a. Lead reviews: task description, all rejection reasons (from br comment list), builder implementation attempts (from file changes), acceptance criteria
   -   b. Lead may take any of these actions:
   -        - Restructure the task into smaller sub-tasks
   -        - Adjust acceptance criteria if determined to be overly strict
   -        - Reassign to a different builder agent
   -        - Identify and resolve underlying architectural issues
   -   c. Record lead decision:
   -        br comment add <bead_id> 'lead-escalation:max-rejections-reached lead:tech-lead-orchestrator action:<lead_decision>'
   -   d. Reset tracking baseline:
   -        Write a new 'status:in_progress' comment from lead — this becomes the new baseline for REJECTION_COUNT
   -        (Subsequent rejection counts are relative to comments after this new baseline)
   -   e. Allow one additional review cycle with lead's guidance included in the builder prompt
   - Step 5 — If still failing after lead escalation:
   -   PAUSE for user decision (abort task, force-close, or escalate further)

**9. Utility: State Machine Transition Validator**
   Inline utility called before any status transition to verify it is legal and then execute it atomically. References get_sub_state (order 7). AC: FR-SM-1, FR-SM-4, FR-SM-8, AC-SM-5

   - Valid transitions table (current_state -> [allowed target_states]):
   -   open        -> in_progress   (actor: lead)
   -   in_progress -> in_review     (actor: builder)
   -   in_progress -> in_qa         (actor: lead, when REVIEWER_ENABLED=false)
   -   in_progress -> closed        (actor: lead, when REVIEWER_ENABLED=false AND QA_ENABLED=false)
   -   in_review   -> in_qa         (actor: reviewer, verdict: approved)
   -   in_review   -> in_progress   (actor: reviewer, verdict: rejected)
   -   in_qa       -> closed        (actor: qa, verdict: passed)
   -   in_qa       -> in_progress   (actor: qa, verdict: rejected)
   - Validation and transition algorithm (call this before any status change):
   - Step 1: call get_sub_state(bead_id) — capture (current_state, metadata)
   - Step 2: look up VALID_TRANSITIONS[current_state] to get the set of allowed target states
   - Step 3: if target_state NOT in allowed set:
   -   Print: 'ERROR: Invalid transition from {current_state} to {target_state} for bead {bead_id}'
   -   HALT
   - Step 4: if target_state IS valid, execute the transition:
   -   a. Build comment_string: 'status:{target_state} {key}:{value} ...' (include actor, verdict, and any other relevant metadata keys from caller)
   -   b. Run: br comment add <bead_id> '<comment_string>'
   -   c. Run: br sync --flush-only
   -   d. If target_state == 'closed': run br close <bead_id> --reason='<metadata.reason if provided, else QA passed>'
   -   e. If target_state == 'in_progress' AND current_state was 'in_review' or 'in_qa' (i.e., a rejection path):
   -      Run: br update <bead_id> --status=open  (reset native br status so lead can re-assign)

### Phase 4: Quality Gate

**1. Phase Completion Detection**
   Detect when all tasks in a phase are closed

   - After each task completion: run br list --status=open --json, filter by title prefix [trd:<TRD_SLUG>:phase:<N>] to find tasks for this phase
   - If no open tasks remain for this phase: trigger quality gate for this story/phase

**2. Test Execution**
   Delegate test suite execution to test-runner, with scope adjusted for team mode. AC: FR-QA-7

   - TRD-031 — Phase Quality Gate Scope Reduction for Team QA (AC: FR-QA-7):
   - 
   - When TEAM_MODE=true AND QA_ENABLED=true (per-task QA already ran via step 3b for each task):
   -   Phase gate focuses on INTEGRATION-ONLY scope:
   -   a. Delegate to @test-runner: run INTEGRATION test suite only for files modified in this phase
   -      (exclude unit tests — these were already validated per-task by QA agent)
   -      Prompt: 'Run integration test suite for phase <N> files: <files_list>. Report pass/fail and integration coverage %.'
   -   b. Cross-file consistency checks:
   -      - Verify API contracts are consistent across changed files (no mismatched request/response shapes)
   -      - Verify shared types and interfaces are used consistently across module boundaries
   -      - Verify module import/export contracts are intact (no broken references)
   -   c. Aggregate coverage report:
   -      - Collect per-task coverage data from QA verdict comments (verdict:passed lines with coverage metadata)
   -      - Compute aggregate coverage across all phase tasks
   -      - Confirm aggregate coverage meets strategy target
   -   Parse results: gate_passed = integration_tests_pass AND aggregate_coverage >= target
   -   Exception: strategy=characterization or flexible -> gate_passed = true (informational only)
   -   Note: Phase gate does NOT re-run per-task unit tests or per-task AC validation (already done by QA per task).
   - 
   - When TEAM_MODE=false (v2.1.0 single-agent mode — no per-task QA ran, full gate required):
   -   Delegate to @test-runner: run full test suite (unit + integration) for files modified in this phase;
   -   report pass/fail, unit coverage %, integration coverage %, failures with file:line
   -   Parse results: gate_passed = tests_pass AND unit_cov >= target AND int_cov >= target
   -   Exception: strategy=characterization or flexible -> gate_passed = true (informational only)
   - 
   - When TEAM_MODE=true AND QA_ENABLED=false (team mode active but no QA agent configured — no per-task QA ran, full gate required):
   -   Delegate to @test-runner: run full test suite (unit + integration) for files modified in this phase;
   -   report pass/fail, unit coverage %, integration coverage %, failures with file:line
   -   Parse results: gate_passed = tests_pass AND unit_cov >= target AND int_cov >= target
   -   Exception: strategy=characterization or flexible -> gate_passed = true (informational only)

**3. Gate Result Recording**
   Record quality gate outcome as br comment and close story on pass

   - TRD-031 — Gate result comment format depends on scope (team mode vs full):
   - 
   - When TEAM_MODE=true AND QA_ENABLED=true (integration-only scope):
   -   Run: br comment add <STORY_BEAD_ID> 'Quality gate result: <PASS|FAIL> | integration: <X tests> | aggregate-coverage: <Y%> | scope: integration-only (team-QA)'
   -   If TEAM_METRICS is populated (TRD-034): append team metrics summary:
   -     br comment add <STORY_BEAD_ID> 'team-metrics phase:<N> tasks:<tasks_completed> first-pass-rate:<X%> total-rejections:<Y>'
   - 
   - When TEAM_MODE=false (v2.1.0 single-agent mode — no per-task QA ran, full unit + integration gate required):
   -   Run: br comment add <STORY_BEAD_ID> 'Quality gate result: <PASS|FAIL> | unit: <X%> | integration: <Y%> | strategy: <strategy>'
   - 
   - When TEAM_MODE=true AND QA_ENABLED=false (team mode but no QA agent configured — no per-task QA ran, full unit + integration gate required):
   -   Run: br comment add <STORY_BEAD_ID> 'Quality gate result: <PASS|FAIL> | unit: <X%> | integration: <Y%> | strategy: <strategy>'
   - 
   - Run: br sync --flush-only
   - If gate_passed: br close <STORY_BEAD_ID> --reason='Phase complete - quality gate passed'; br sync --flush-only; git commit -m 'chore(phase <N>): checkpoint (tests pass; unit <X%>, int <Y%>)'
   - If gate_passed AND more phases remain AND TEAM_MODE=true: reset TEAM_METRICS for the next phase:
   -   TEAM_METRICS = { phase: <N+1>, tasks_completed: 0, builders: {}, task_details: [] }
   -   (This ensures phase N+1 accumulates fresh metrics and does not inherit stale phase-N data.)
   - If NOT gate_passed AND blocking strategy (tdd/refactor/bug-fix): print gate failure details; PAUSE for user: fix/skip/abort

**4. Team Performance Summary (TEAM_MODE=true only)**
   Print and persist team performance metrics after Quality Gate step 3 when TEAM_MODE=true and TEAM_METRICS is populated. AC: FR-TM-4, FR-TM-5

   - TRD-035 — Team Performance Summary (TEAM_MODE=true AND TEAM_METRICS populated, after Gate Result Recording):
   - 
   - Condition: execute this step only when TEAM_MODE=true AND TEAM_METRICS.tasks_completed > 0
   - 
   - 1. Compute derived metrics:
   -    - total_rejections = sum of rejection_cycles across all entries in TEAM_METRICS.task_details
   -    - first_pass_rate = (first_pass_approvals_count / TEAM_METRICS.tasks_completed) * 100
   -      where first_pass_approvals_count = number of entries in TEAM_METRICS.task_details where first_pass_approval == true
   -    - Per-builder breakdown: for each builder_agent in TEAM_METRICS.builders:
   -        builder_tasks = TEAM_METRICS.builders[builder_agent].tasks
   -        builder_first_pass = TEAM_METRICS.builders[builder_agent].first_pass_approvals
   -        builder_rejections = TEAM_METRICS.builders[builder_agent].rejections
   - 
   - 2. Print team performance summary block to console:
   -    === TEAM PERFORMANCE SUMMARY — Phase <TEAM_METRICS.phase> ===
   -    Tasks completed: <TEAM_METRICS.tasks_completed>
   -    First-pass approval rate: <first_pass_rate>%
   -    Total rejection cycles: <total_rejections>
   -    Per-builder breakdown:
   -      <builder_agent>: tasks=<builder_tasks> first-pass=<builder_first_pass> rejections=<builder_rejections>
   -      (repeat for each builder in TEAM_METRICS.builders)
   -    === END TEAM SUMMARY ===
   - 
   - 3. Persist metrics as br comment on ROOT_EPIC_ID (not story bead — epic captures cross-phase history):
   -    - Build BUILDERS_JSON per TRD-036 schema (see below)
   -    - Run: br comment add <ROOT_EPIC_ID> 'team-metrics:phase-<N> tasks:<tasks_completed> first-pass-rate:<first_pass_rate>% total-rejections:<total_rejections> builders:<BUILDERS_JSON>'
   - 
   -    TRD-036 — BUILDERS_JSON Schema:
   -    BUILDERS_JSON is a JSON-encoded object with the following top-level structure:
   -    {
   -      "phase": <N>,
   -      "tasks_completed": <integer>,
   -      "first_pass_rate": <float, 0.0-100.0>,
   -      "total_rejections": <integer>,
   -      "avg_rejection_cycles": <float>,
   -      "builders": {
   -        "<builder_agent_type>": {
   -          "tasks": <integer>,
   -          "first_pass_approvals": <integer>,
   -          "rejections": <integer>,
   -          "first_pass_rate": <float, 0.0-100.0>
   -        }
   -      }
   -    }
   -    Derivation rules:
   -    - avg_rejection_cycles = total_rejections / tasks_completed (0.0 if tasks_completed == 0)
   -    - Per-builder first_pass_rate = (first_pass_approvals / tasks) * 100
   -    - top-level first_pass_rate = (first_pass_approvals_count / tasks_completed) * 100 (same as step 1 above)
   - 
   - 4. Run: br sync --flush-only (ensure metrics comment is persisted)

### Phase 5: Completion

**1. Epic Closure**
   Close the root epic when all children are done

   - Verify: br list --status=open --json filtered by TRD slug returns no open tasks
   - Run: br close <ROOT_EPIC_ID> --reason='TRD implementation complete'
   - Run: br sync --flush-only

**2. TRD Checkbox Sync**
   Update TRD file checkboxes to reflect bead closure state

   - For each task in TRD Master Task List: if TRD_TO_BEAD_MAP[task.id] exists and bead status == 'closed' -> replace '- [ ] **<task.id>**' with '- [x] **<task.id>**'
   - git commit -m 'docs(TRD): sync checkboxes to bead closure state'

**3. Completion Report**
   Print final summary and remind user about PR creation

   - Print completion report: TRD file, branch, strategy, epic ID, task counts, coverage summary
   - Requirement Satisfaction Table: scan ROOT_EPIC_ID comments for req-verified: tokens
   -   Run: br comment list <ROOT_EPIC_ID>
   -   If br comment list fails or returns non-JSON: print 'WARNING: Could not read root epic comments — req-verified data unavailable. Run /ensemble:requirement-status <TRD_SLUG> to generate the report manually.' Continue with empty VERIFIED_REQS.
   -   Parse each comment for tokens: req-verified:REQ-NNN, by:TRD-NNN-TEST, qa:<agent>, reviewer:<agent>, ac-proven:AC-NNN-M,...
   -   Build VERIFIED_REQS map: REQ-NNN -> {test_task, qa_agent, reviewer_agent, acs_proven, verification_mode}
   -   For each req-verified token: check if the comment contains 'reviewer:code-reviewer' (TEAM_MODE=false code-review path) vs 'qa:<agent>' (TEAM_MODE=true QA path); set verification_mode accordingly: 'code-review' or 'qa-verified'
   -   If TRD has PRD reference: also load PRD REQ-NNN list for cross-reference (unverified reqs show as NOT VERIFIED)
   -   Print table:
   -     === REQUIREMENT SATISFACTION REPORT ===
   -     REQ-001: SATISFIED(qa-verified) (TRD-001-TEST) — ACs: AC-001-1, AC-001-2
   -     REQ-002: NOT VERIFIED (TRD-002-TEST still open)
   -     REQ-003: SATISFIED(code-review) (TRD-007-TEST) — ACs: AC-003-1, AC-003-2, AC-003-3
   -     TOTAL: <N> satisfied / <M> total requirements
   -     Note: SATISFIED(code-review) = verified via TEAM_MODE=false code-reviewer approval; SATISFIED(qa-verified) = verified via TEAM_MODE=true QA agent
   -     ========================================
   - Run: br sync --flush-only
   - If BV_AVAILABLE: run bv --robot-triage --format toon for final progress summary
   - If not BV_AVAILABLE: run br list --status=open --json filtered by TRD slug (expect empty)
   - Remind user: git diff main...<branch>; gh pr create; after merge: mv <trd_file> docs/TRD/completed/
   - Remind user: br sync --flush-only && git add .beads/ && git commit -m 'chore: final beads sync'
   - Do NOT auto-create PR — user must run gh pr create manually
